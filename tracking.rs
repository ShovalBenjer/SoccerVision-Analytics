//! # Module `tracking.rs`
//!
//! This module implements object tracking, associating detections from consecutive video frames
//! to maintain object identities over time. It uses a simple Intersection-over-Union (IOU) based
//! tracking algorithm as a placeholder. For production use, this module should be replaced with
//! a more robust tracking algorithm like ByteTrack, potentially integrated via FFI with Python.
//!
//! ## Functionality:
//!
//! 1.  **Object Tracking:** Associates object detections across video frames to create tracks,
//!     assigning unique `track_id`s to each tracked object. The current implementation uses
//!     a basic IOU-based association method.
//! 2.  **Tracking Stability Assessment:** Calculates a basic score to estimate the stability
//!     of the tracking process, based on track switches and track length variations. This is a
//!     rudimentary metric and can be improved with more sophisticated analysis.
//!
//! ## Placeholder Implementation:
//!
//! The current tracking algorithm is a simplified placeholder for demonstration and testing.
//! It relies on:
//!
//! *   **IOU (Intersection-over-Union) Matching:** Associates detections in the current frame
//!     with existing tracks from the previous frame based on the IOU between their bounding boxes.
//! *   **Greedy Assignment:**  Assigns detections to tracks greedily based on the highest IOU.
//! *   **Track Management:** Creates new tracks for unassigned detections and removes tracks
//!     that have not been detected for a certain number of frames.
//!
//! **Limitations of Placeholder:**
//!
//! *   **Simple IOU-based Tracking:**  IOU tracking is prone to identity switches, especially
//!     in crowded scenes or with occlusions.
//! *   **No Motion Prediction:**  The placeholder does not use motion prediction to improve
//!     tracking through occlusions or when objects are moving fast.
//! *   **Basic Stability Metric:** The `calculate_tracking_stability_score` function provides
//!     a very basic estimate of tracking quality and is not a comprehensive metric.
//!
//! ## Intended External Integration (Placeholder):
//!
//! For a production-ready system, this module should be replaced with integration with a
//! more advanced tracking algorithm like ByteTrack. This would likely involve:
//!
//! 1.  **ByteTrack Implementation (Python):** Implementing or using a pre-existing ByteTrack
//!     algorithm in Python (or another suitable language with good ML library support).
//!
//! 2.  **FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** Using Rust-Python FFI (like `pyo3`) to:
//!     *   Pass detection data (bounding boxes, confidence scores) from Rust to Python.
//!     *   Call the ByteTrack algorithm in Python to perform tracking.
//!     *   Receive the tracking results (track IDs, updated bounding boxes) back in Rust.
//!
//! 3.  **Replacing Placeholder in `track_objects_in_frames`:**  Replace the current IOU-based
//!     placeholder logic in `track_objects_in_frames` with the FFI call to the external
//!     ByteTrack implementation.
//!
//! ## Usage:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use video_analytics::tracking;
//! use video_analytics::object_detection::{Detection}; // Assuming object_detection module is in the same crate
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
//!     // Example detections (replace with actual detections from object_detection module)
//!     let frame_detections_list = vec![
//!         vec![Detection { object_type: "player".to_string(), bounding_box: (10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0), confidence: 0.8 }],
//!         vec![Detection { object_type: "player".to_string(), bounding_box: (15.0, 25.0, 35.0, 45.0), confidence: 0.9 }],
//!         vec![], // Empty detections in frame 3 (object lost)
//!         vec![Detection { object_type: "player".to_string(), bounding_box: (20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0), confidence: 0.7 }],
//!     ];
//!
//!     let tracked_objects_result = tracking::track_objects_in_frames(&frame_detections_list);
//!
//!     match tracked_objects_result {
//!         Ok(tracked_objects_frames) => {
//!             println!("Tracked objects in {} frames:", tracked_objects_frames.len());
//!             for (frame_index, frame_tracks) in tracked_objects_frames.iter().enumerate() {
//!                 println!("Frame {}: {} tracked objects", frame_index, frame_tracks.len());
//!                 for tracked_obj in frame_tracks {
//!                     println!("  Track ID: {}, Type: {}, Last BBox: {:?}", tracked_obj.track_id, tracked_obj.object_type, tracked_obj.bounding_box_history.last());
//!                 }
//!             }
//!             let stability_score = tracking::calculate_tracking_stability_score(&tracked_objects_frames);
//!             println!("Tracking Stability Score: {:.2}", stability_score);
//!         }
//!         Err(err) => {
//!             eprintln!("Error during object tracking: {}", err);
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **Note:** This module provides a basic placeholder tracking implementation. For robust and
//! accurate object tracking in real-world video analysis, integration with a dedicated
//! tracking algorithm (like ByteTrack) is highly recommended.
