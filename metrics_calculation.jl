    calculate_player_metrics(tracked_objects_frames)

Calculates various performance metrics for players based on tracked object data.

This function iterates through each frame and each tracked player object to compute metrics like
position, speed, distance run, and placeholder metrics for possession, passing, dribbling, defense,
scoring, and creating chances.

# Arguments
- `tracked_objects_frames`: A vector of vectors of `DummyTrackedObject` representing tracked objects in each frame.

# Returns
- `DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing player-specific metrics, with each row representing a player in a frame.

Julia

Key improvements and additions in this version:

More Placeholder Metrics: Added placeholder dummy metrics for possession, passing, dribbling, defense, scoring, and creating chances in calculate_player_metrics. These are all currently using random numbers or very basic logic and are meant to be replaced with actual event detection and metric calculation logic.

calculate_ball_metrics Function: Added a new function to calculate metrics specifically for the ball (currently just position and placeholder speed).

Expanded calculate_team_metrics: calculate_team_metrics now includes examples of calculating average speed, median speed, speed standard deviation, total distance run, total goals, average xG, total touches, and a basic (and potentially inaccurate) team pass accuracy. These are still examples and can be expanded and refined.

Docstrings: Added docstrings (comments explaining function purpose, arguments, returns) to all exported functions and the module itself, following a docstring style similar to Python's PEP 257, which is common practice in Julia as well.

Module Includes: The code now explicitly includes the helper functions module (metrics_calculation_utils.jl) and the placeholder modules (event_detection_dummy.jl, xg_model_dummy.jl, xa_model_dummy.jl).

Remember that this is still a placeholder implementation, especially regarding the metric calculations themselves. The dummy metrics are for demonstration purposes only and need to be replaced with real logic based on event detection and more sophisticated algorithms.
